## Tickrate Enabler 1.4 by ProdigySim

https://www.l4dnation.com/confogl-and-other-configs/l4d12-tickrate-enabler-1-0/

### Description

Enables the "-tickrate" switch to be used from the command line to set the game's tickrate.

Patches Boomer Vomit behavior to fix an issue where vomit range scaled inversely with tickrate.

Removes global upper-limits on the max client data rate (was 30000),
and removes the (30k) limits on rate control cvars:
- sv_maxrate
- sv_minrate
- net_splitpacket_maxrate

### Instructions

1. Place tickrate_enabler.dll (Windows) or tickrate_enabler.so (Linux) in your server's addons folder.
2. Place tickrate_enabler.vdf (L4D2) or tickrate_enabler_l4d1.vdf (L4D1) in your server's addons folder.
3. Add "-tickrate <desired_tickrate>" to your server's launch parameters. e.g. -tickrate 100
4. Make sure the following convar settings are properly set in server.cfg or otherwise:

    sv_maxupdaterate 100
    sv_maxcmdrate 100
    fps_max 150 // higher than 100 recommended, as ticks calculated seems to dip otherwise.
	sv_maxrate 0 // 0 = unlimited, but you can also set this manually. Default is 30k for 30tick, use math.
	// Setting higher sv_minrate can be used to force users to use higher data rates.
	
	Note that fps_max and sv_maxrate are hidden variables on most scenarios.

5. Done. Enjoy 100 tick L4D2 gameplay.
